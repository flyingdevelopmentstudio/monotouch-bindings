    <remarks>
      <para>
        Google's AdMob allows application developers to connect with advertisers and show relevant ads in their app. To use Google's AdMob, application developers must sign up with the Google AdMob service (<format type="text/html"><a href="http://www.google.com/ads/admob">http://www.google.com/ads/admob</a></format>). 
      </para>
      <para>
        All uses of the AdMob service require the application developer's Publisher ID, which is available on the AdMob administrative Web page in the "Sites &amp; Apps" section.
      </para>
      <para>
        There are two types of AdMob ad: banner advertisements in standard IAB sizes and interstitial ads which are displayed at significant transition points in the application (startup, prior to video, etc.). Banner ads are represented by the <see cref="T:GoogleAdMobAds.GADBannerView"/> class and interstitial ads are represented by the <see cref="T:GoogleAdMobAds.GADInterstitial"/> class.
